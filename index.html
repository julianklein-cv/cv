    as my supervisor.
    My research considers the verification of confidentiality properties of real-time systems.

    Timed systems are hard to verify by design and the verification problem of timed opacity is generally undecidable.
    I therefore consider restricted time semantics to make the problem tractable.
    Besides my work as a researcher, I am also a teaching assistant. 
    This includes supervision of theses, project work with small groups of students, and a large
    undergraduate courses with over 700 students.

    <b>Topic:</b> Formal Verification and Enforcement of Confidentiality Properties in Time-Sensitive Systems<br />
    <b>Supervisor:</b> Prof. Dr. Sabine Glesner <br />
    <b>Summary:</b> <br />
    My research considers the verification of confidentiality properties of real-time systems.
    In particular, I develop methods to automatically guarantee that a given system cannot leak secret information to a malicious intruder who observes the system.
    As a formal notion of confidentiality, I use the opacity framework.

    Timed systems are hard to verify by design, and the verification problem of timed opacity is generally undecidable.
    I therefore consider restricted time semantics to make the problem more tractable.
    My goal with my research is to prove the real-world applicability of the opacity framework for verification of real-time systems.
    Related works currently only consider settings that massively restrict the real-world applicability.
    Moreover, most of these works are purely theoretical.
    The goal of my PhD is to produce the first software prototype that can actually be used to verify and enforce full timed opacity of a given system.

    <b>Thesis:</b> Verifying and Enforcing Opacity of Timed Automata<br />
    <b>Examiners:</b> Prof. Dr. Sabine Glesner, Prof. Dr. Stephan Kreutzer <br />
    <b>Summary:</b> <br />
    Opacity is a powerful confidentiality property that holds if a system can not leak secret information through observable behavior. 
    As time has become an increasingly popular attack vector, opacity has been extended to timed systems, modeled as timed automata (TA). 
    However, opacity verification on TA in a dense time model has been proven to be undecidable. 
    In this work, we consider timed opacity in a discrete time model. 
    We prove that opacity of TA can be verified in this setting and provide an algorithmic approach to do so. 
    Furthermore, we provide an opacity enforcement mechanism, ensuring opacity for unsafe systems. 
    <br />
    We present two methods for this purpose.
    The first method uses tick automata which we derive from the given TA.
    Tick automata are standard FA that can model discrete time using a special tick-symbol.
    We prove that a transformation from TA (in the discrete-time model) to tick automata is possible.
    Moreover, we improve the efficiency of this transformation with a new, local time abstraction.
    Once the tick automaton is derived, we can use known opacity verification and enforcement methods for FA since tick automata are standard FA.
    However, this method does not scale well since the verification and enforcement methods scale exponentially with the state space of the tick automaton, which explodes for large input TA.
    <br />
    Our second method uses deterministic interval automata (IA) as an estimator model and we adapt the all insertion structure (AIS) by Wu and Lafortune to IA.
    In a practical evaluation, we have implemented both methods and proved that our second method scales in fact better than our first method.
    We have evaluated both methods on six case studies and randomized TA.
    <br />
    After the thesis was submitted, we published parts of it as a scientific paper at the international conference on formal methods in software engineering (FormaliSE) 2024.
    The software prototype of our evaluation was published as an open source research artifact and was evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee.
    We received the functional and available badges.

    <b>Thesis:</b> Improving Confidentiality Enforcement through Symbolic Information Flow Analysis <br />
    <b>Examiners:</b> Prof. Dr. Sabine Glesner, Prof. Dr. Florian Tschorsch <br />
    <b>Summary:</b> <br />
    The goal of my bachelor thesis was to develop a better data flow analysis on low level code for the PhD project of my supervisor
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r3lijwMAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=sra" class="text-link">
      Tobias Pfeffer
    </a>.
    His research goal was to build a fully automatic enforcement method for non-interference on binaries.
    For this purpose, he was using secure multi execution (SME), which executes the original program multiple times.
    The idea is to execute the program once for each security level of the input channels.
    This way, non-interference holds by design, since inputs of lower security levels do not exist within the same execution.
    The tradeoff is the cost of the additional execution time.
    To tackle this problem, Tobias proposed the demand-driven secure multi execution (DDSME) method that does not execute the whole program several times, but only critical sections of it.
    A critical section is part of the program, where interference might happen.
    To determine over approximations the critical sections, analysis of the control flow graph is sufficient.
    However, tighter critical sections can be found by more sophisticated methods.
    In my thesis, I developed a data-flow sensitive code analysis that was able to provide tighter critical sections than the previous control flow-based method.
    We thereby managed to reduce the overall runtime of the DDSME method.
