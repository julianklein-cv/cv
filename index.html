  <h2>A Unified Method to Efficiently Verify Opacity of Discrete-Timed Automata</h2>
  <p>
    Building on our definition of threshold estimators and the concurrent composition by Zhang and Giua, we define the
    timed concurrent composition (TCC) as a verification structure to verify several timed opacity notions on
    discrete-timed automata.
    This is thus another continuation on prevoius works on the verification of opacity in discrete-timed automata.
    Moreover, this was my first international collaboration with Kuize Zhang.
  </p>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Opacity is a powerful confidentiality property which guarantees that secret information of a system cannot be
    inferred from its observable behavior. To account for timing attacks, opacity has been extended to continuous-time
    systems, but the verification problem was proven to be generally undecidable. As a result, multiple recent works
    study the opacity verification problem of discrete-timed automata. The advantage of a discrete time setting is that
    it can discretize any timed automaton as a discrete-state system, where opacity can be verified. However, such
    verification methods usually rely on separating time steps into distinct hybrid states. This results in state
    explosion and limited scalability for real-world problems.
    In this paper, we present a new, more efficient verification method for opacity in a discrete time setting that
    avoids the state explosion problem. Our verification method groups multiple time steps to intervals, instead of
    evaluating each time step individually. We define four timed opacity notions and show that our method is capable of
    verifying all of them in a unified manner. We analyze the efficiency of our method on a case study of a wireless
    sensor network and randomized systems.</p>

  <h2>Efficient State Estimation of Discrete-Timed Automata</h2>
  <p>
    A continuation of our work on the verification of current-state opacity (CSO) on discrete timed automata.
    We develop a new verification structure, called threshold estimator (TE).
    We show that CSO can be efficiently verified using TE on several case studies.
    The paper was published in the proceedings of the 2024 25th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods
    (ICFEM).
  </p>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>State estimation is a fundamental method in control theory that has applications in privacy, fault diagnosis, and
    the verification of other state inference properties. State estimation methods for timed automata rely on
    discretizing time into atomic steps. These discrete time steps are enumerated in separate states, significantly
    limiting scalability for large, realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a more efficient state estimation
    method for discrete-timed automata. The key idea of our approach is to avoid the enumeration of single time steps
    when possible. We provide a formal definition of a new state estimator model and an efficient algorithmic approach
    to derive it from discrete-timed automata. We validate our method on 11 realistic case studies and show a
    significant decrease in computational costs.</p>

  <h2>Verifying Opacity of Discrete-Timed Automata</h2>
  <p>
    We prove that opacity can be verified in discrete-timed automata.
    To facilitate this, we provide a verification method for current-state opacity (CSO) using tick automata.
    To make the method more efficient, we develop the local time abstraction, reducing the size of the tick automata.
    Our paper is the first to report a decidability result on the verification problem of opacity in discrete timed
    automata.
    However, two concurrent works by

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Opacity is a powerful confidentiality property that holds if a system cannot leak secret information through
    observable behavior. In recent years, time has become an increasingly popular attack vector. The notion of opacity
    has therefore been extended to timed automata (TA). However, the verification of opacity of TA has been proven to be
    undecidable for the commonly used dense time model. To make the problem decidable, state of the art approaches
    consider weaker notions of opacity or heavily restrict the class of considered TA, resulting in unrealistic threat
    models.
    In this paper, we address the problem of verifying opacity of TA without restrictions. For this purpose, we consider
    a discrete time setting. We present a novel algorithm to transform TA to equivalent finite automata (FA) and then
    use known methods to verify opacity of the resulting FA. To improve the efficiency of our algorithm, we use a novel
    time abstraction that significantly reduces the state space of the resulting FA, improving the scalability of our
    approach. We validate our method using randomized systems, as well as four case studies from the literature showing
    that our approach is applicable in practice.</p>

  <h2>A Systematic Study on the Potentials and Limitations of LLM-assisted Software Development</h2>
  <p>
    I co-authored this paper on LLM-assisted software development.
    It was joint work with my colleagues and two students who wrote their theses on the topic.
  </p>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>In the field of software engineering, Large Language Models like GPT have gained enormous interest in recent times.
    With its expanding area of application, ChatGPT has become an essential tool for code generation. Several studies
    have shown that the quality of generated code depends on the underlying dataset and the quality of the provided
    prompts. However, its precise capabilities and limitations remain uncertain, as does the extent of assistance
    required for effective code generation. We present the results of our systematic study in which we investigate the
    potential of ChatGPT, based on GPT-4, in solving assignments of an introductory-level programming class. We examine
    the impact of programming language choice, different prompting strategies, and the results of the model compared to
    those of real students. Our results show that ChatGPT cannot solve the assignments independently, but outperforms
    the average student with human assistance.</p>

      <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>

      <p>
        I am a PhD student at the
        <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/sese" class="text-link">
          <span>software and embedded systems engineering (SESE) group</span>
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/eecs/institutions/institutes/institute-of-software-engineering-and-theoretical-computer-science"
          class="text-link">
          <span>institute of software engineering and theoretical computer science</span>
        </a>
        at TU Berlin.
        The focus of my research is to guarantee confidentiality properties
        in time-sensitive systems. Besides my work as a researcher, I am also a teaching assistant. This
        includes supervision of theses, project work with small groups of students, and a large
        undergraduate courses with over 700 students.
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science at TU Berlin.
        Throughout my studies, I found topics in theoretical computer science and especially regarding formal
        verification most interesting.
        In both my theses, I worked on formal verification methods of confidentiality properties of timed systems.
        In particular, as part of my master thesis, I first proved the opacity verification problem for discrete-timed
        automata to be decidable - a result that has been independently re-established multiple times since.
        I continue the topic of verification and enforcement of opacity of discrete-timed automata in my research as a
        PhD student.
        My goal with my PhD is to develop scalable methods to guarantee timed opacity that can be used on actual
        real-world applications (see publications for more information).

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Besides my studies I worked over four years as a tutor, teaching classes of up to 50 students at a time.
        This work involved also involved consultation hours and design and grading of homeworks and exams.
        With the start of my PhD, I also became a teaching assistant with the same teaching tasks and many additional
        responsibilities.
        These responsibilities mainly involve the organization and examination of classes.
        Besides that, I also supervise theses.
